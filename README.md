# Oi!

I'm Jado ("dʒeɪdoʊ"). I am the Director of Development @ [TracTru](https://tractru.com), as well as a passionate back-end developer who loves writing in PHP & Go. I don't care for JavaScript/TypeScript, but don't let that stop us from being friends. 😃

## The Fun Stuff

I love:

- 👑 Jesus
- ☕️ Coffee ([Grit](https://gritcoffee.com) has the best beans!)
- ⚙️ [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com) – The factory must grow...
- 📖 Reading

I like:

- 🕹️ Board Games (you might even say that I have _too_ many)
- 🪑 Woodworking
- 📱 Technology
