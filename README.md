# Hi, I’m Jado (pronounced “JAY-doe”).

I’m a senior software engineer with a background spanning backend systems, web platforms, infrastructure, and engineering leadership. I’ve spent the last decade building and maintaining production systems, integrating third-party services, and improving reliability and developer experience across teams.

## Focus Areas
- Backend and full-stack application development
- System design and architecture
- Data modeling and performance
- Infrastructure, CI/CD, and operational reliability
- Pragmatic use of AI as a development accelerator

## Primary Technologies
**Languages:** PHP, Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, Ruby  
**Frameworks:** Laravel, Symfony, React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte  
**Data & Infra:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Linux, Docker, NGINX

I care about correctness, maintainability, and building systems that are easy for teams to understand and evolve over time.

Outside of work, I enjoy coffee, cooking, Linux tinkering, and games like Factorio and Rocket League.
