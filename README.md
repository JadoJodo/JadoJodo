# Hi!
I'm Jado ("dʒeɪdoʊ"), a geek with a passion for learning and a soft spot for strongly-typed languages.

### The Tech Stack
* PHP, Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, NodeJS, Ruby, CSS (and a whole bunch of others, but I won't bore you with the long-tail)
* Laravel, Symfony, Vue.js, React.js, Next.js, Nuxt.js, AngularJS, Svelte.js, Express, NestJS, Rails, Bootstrap/Tailwind, Spring (you get the idea)
* NGINX, Apache, Caddy, MySQL, MSSQL, PGSQL, Redis (because who doesn't love a good homelab?)

### Controversial Takes
* Windows XP was, in fact, the best Windows (don't @ me)
* XML is the actual worst (no debate necessary)
* PHP has gotten REALLY good (I know, I'm surprised too)
* GraphQL is overused (but hey, at least it's not XML)

### The Fun Stuff
* I'm all about ☕️ coffee, 🥘 cooking, and 🐧 Linux (because what's a geek without a love for Linux?)
* When I'm not coding, you can find me playing ⚙️ Factorio or 🥅 Rocket League
* My music tastes are all over the place, but 🎸 Death Metal and 🎹 Electronica are definitely up there
